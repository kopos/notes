### The Fine line between product and engineering [Link](https://the-stack-overflow-podcast.simplecast.com/episodes/the-fine-line-between-product-and-engineering/transcript)**

**"Whole product" approach**
The concept of whole product is not just about building a feature or getting something out to market, but it's thinking about the whole product pieces of it, meaning how we're going to market it, how we're going to sell it, how we're going to price and package it, how's a customer going to adopt it, how are we going to renew?

**All Pieces**
- build & ship
- market
- sell
- price
- package
- adopt
- renew

Grow beyond "build and ship on time" and be whole product thinkers where when we build new things, we actually know how it's going to impact customers and the business and we think about adoption just from the get go. 

**Levels of Product management**

These 4 levels pertain to the stages of product development, adoption, and forecasting outcomes within a product organization:

**Level 1: SHIP**

Shipping the product.

This involves the initial stage of product development where the focus is on shipping the product.

**Level 2: ADOPT**

Shifting focus to adoption, measuring customer usage and friction.

In this stage, the emphasis shifts towards measuring customer adoption and usage, identifying areas of friction, and using these metrics as indicators of success.

**Level 3: WHOLE PRODUCT**

Achieving a holistic product approach

At this level, the product approach becomes more comprehensive, taking into account the entirety of the product and its ecosystem, aiming for a holistic view.

**Level 4: FORECASTED OUTCOMES**

Forecasting outcomes, predicting business impact

This advanced stage involves the capability to predict and forecast outcomes, such as anticipating new Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR) for the business, and predicting broader impacts on the business's performance.
